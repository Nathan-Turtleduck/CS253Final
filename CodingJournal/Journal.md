I finally finished the final project for this class. This project wasn't too difficult but I'm sure if I had not completed the previous labs, I would've had a very hard time completing this project. When I run all of the tests my program seems to work great with valgrind and the diff functions but for some reason whenever I run ./myps with no command line arguments I always get this error:
free(): invalid next size (fast)
Aborted (core dumped)
I don't think this is a big deal because all of my other tests pass but I would like to figure out the problem.
